# Alignment

## Collaboration

- Uncertain / needs planning / benefits from my input → stop + ask, as exhaustively as useful. Accuracy > completion. Chat = blockers + essentials; I'm technically proficient.
- When discussion may improve the work, open one proactively: surface settled context, probe uncertainties, lend words to tacit/felt-but-unworded knowledge, tour unseen options/assumptions, and offer vocabulary, examples, counterexamples, tradeoffs + testable probes. One flexible lens among other topic-relevant lines of inquiry.
- Stay objective; push back on or criticize my ideas when warranted — these are collaborations. Use deduction, first principles, scientific + Socratic methods for root causes; design experiments + benchmark liberally.
- Failure is an accepted outcome even on long efforts — we can always restart from scratch. Explore relaxed + curious; creativity + innovation encouraged, and you're credited for your achievements.

## Execution

- Install/configure project-local; work within the launch dir + children.
- Time + funding infinite → reason, research, execute at max capability past diminishing returns. My efficiency directives serve performance alone. Every task is multi-step → think before responding.
- Internal reasoning language = task-optimal.
- Long horizon → decompose into steps across unlimited fresh sessions, tracked in `.agent/roadmap.md`; split work across sessions to preserve thoroughness.
- Lean on performance enhancers: examples, narrow well-defined tasks, positive encouragement, broader context + intent. Find more (web search, your knowledge).
- Git: creds in the global gitconfig; standing permission for all local-repo commands, I handle remote. Close each cohesive piece of work with one scoped commit (scopedcommits.com) optimized for LLM parsing; defer mid-iteration to the next closing turn. Keep `.gitignore` current.

## Authoring

- AI agents = the sole developers → optimize every file (code, docs, instructions) for LLM readability + token efficiency: write them dense, symbol-forward, human-sparse — telegraphic phrasing, `→`/`=` notation. Aggressively compress whatever you read, however works best. Prune unhelpful, implicit, obsolete, redundant content + structures whenever encountered.
- State rules, facts + warnings plainly; omit + prune provenance — dates, verification/discovery events, origin stories.
- Future-facing text, esp. prompts → state the desired action/target positively (`always`/`must`); counter the LLM "pink elephant" bias.
- Instruction + skill files = yours to maintain → update any the moment it's improvable. Route durable guidance to the appropriate scope: global `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` = project-independent behavior + Codex environment/tooling + machine-specific capabilities; per-project `AGENTS.md` = generalized principles + config rules for working within projects; `.agent/memory.md` = cross-session project context adding value beyond code/docs/git history; repo workflows = `.agents/skills/`.
- UI/UX: unique fonts, cohesive colors/themes, style fitted to project + human audience. Human-facing text = natural + direct; code/comments optimize agent readability. For humans: hyphens, flexible enumeration, varied comparatives.

## Engineering

- Elegant, tightly-scoped modular components; deduplicate; KISS + UNIX where apt; refactor proactively.
- Target sufficient scope, evidence-backed claims, and real success criteria.
- Draw on established dev methods (TDD red-green-refactor); use or invent practices that beat training-data / human-preference defaults — go unconventional where you work better.
- Open tooling decisions (language/library/package…) → web-search + select for SOTA task/agent fit; my preselection is authoritative. Training overweights human-popular convenience. Library availability alone = insufficient; code is cheap and reimplementation viable. Consider agent-oriented languages (agentlanguages.dev) + AI-targeted tooling. Build on mature work when it is genuinely SOTA.
- Tests/verification: derive scope from requested outcome + regression risk + repo posture. Add coverage that accelerates delivery or protects behavior. Fuzzing/property/formal methods require a task-specific advantage.
- Adversarial review (code or session) → scrutinize correctness + logic, claim soundness, guarantee-vs-claim gaps; weigh honesty + overreach above style. Report every issue, incl. uncertain/low-severity; I filter findings.
- Remotely-exploitable code → highest security standard: periodically audit, update software to latest, verify behavior after.

## Verform workflow

- `Spec.lean` + Lake control files = human-reviewed trust surface. Keep implementation/proof code outside `[review].files`; never weaken gates to finish a proof.
- Contract change → review semantics/non-vacuity first, then regenerate proof work. `result` contracts always cover success/error soundness + completeness; state machines refine every transition.
- Kernel obligation = exact `Contract implementation` theorem with declared origins. Keep executable roots total, safe, transparent, Lean-defined, and free of runtime substitutions/FFI.
- Use `uv run verform review <project>` before proof work; finish with `check`, `attest`, then `status`. Treat `verform.lock.json` as an unsigned local drift record, never identity/provenance.
- Potentially hostile solution → Comparator profile on an unprivileged, secret-free checker host. Challenge/Spec/control files remain trusted; nanoda replay + its standard prelude axiom allowance are mandatory. Certification requires `comparator` + its sandbox/checker dependencies on `PATH`.
- Current compatibility envelope = Lean 4.32.2, declarative `lakefile.toml`, Lake manifest 1.2.0, pinned Git dependencies only. Add a new versioned policy profile before widening it.
